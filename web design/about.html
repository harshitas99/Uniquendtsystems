        <h2>About-Us</h2><br>
        <p>Unique NDT Systems was founded in ... and started its activities in a humble way in the field of Radiography, one of the Non Destructive Testing methods.
The hard work, sincerity and dedication put together have brought her to its present standing with the inclusion of all the NDT test methods under her wing. This includes test methods like Ultrasonic, Magnetic particle, Liquid Penetrant, Eddy current etc. There is not a single project of typical nature in India for which IXAR has not worked and thus vast experience gained, is the base for its full confidence to undertake any challenging job irrespective of size and technical complexities. 26th January 1985 was the land mark day for the company when the office was shifted to a new building and measuring 5000sq, ft. floor space.</p>
